there’s a limitation to autowiring by type. What happens if Spring finds more than
 one bean whose type is assignable to the autowired property? In such a case, Spring
 isn’t going to guess which bean to autowire and will instead throw an exception. 
Consequently, you’re allowed to have only one bean configured that matches the 
autowired property.

To overcome ambiguities with autowiring by type, Spring offers two options: you can either 
identify a primary candidate for autowiring or you can eliminate beans from autowiring candidacy.

1. primary="true"
2. autowire-candidate="false"

add them in respective beans...........
