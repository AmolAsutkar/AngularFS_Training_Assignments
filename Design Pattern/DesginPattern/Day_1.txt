				Design Patterns

1) What are design patterns:
	A general repeatable solution to a commonly occuring problem, it describes how
	to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations.

2) Uses:
	a) Speed up the development process
	b) It improves code readability

3) Types of design patterns:
	a) Creational:
		Used for class instantiation
	b) Structural:
		Used for class and object composition
	c) Behavioral:
		Used for class object communication


Creational
1) Abstract Factory:
	Create an instance of several families of classes.
2) Builder:
	Seperates object construction from its representation.
3) Factory:
	Creates an instance of several derived classes.
4) Object pool:
	Avoid expensive acquisition and release of resources by recycling objects
	that are no longer in use.
5) Prototype:
	A fully initialized instance to copied or clone.
6) Singleton:
	A class of which only a single instance can exists.
